This GitHub repo contains the code necessary for a semi-autonoumous rover that has on-board sensors and uses stereo vision for obstacle avoidance.

This rover uses 3 different Arduino Uno's to perform various functionalites. 2 of the arduino's are connected to a computational unit that handles co-ordination and navigational algorithm. A third Arduino Uno is used to connect to a PC and serve as the remote control for the Rover/
